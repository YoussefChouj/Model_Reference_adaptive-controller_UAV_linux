/* UART baud toward the long-range radio module. HARDWARE REPLACED 2026-07-31: the
 * 24RF/nRF24L01 pair is gone; USART3 now drives a 2.4 GHz BLE serial module (Yuanxi),
 * configured to 921600 on BOTH ends with its Windows tool. The old 115200 figure and
 * the "no AT command can change the baud" conclusion belonged to the retired hardware.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-07-31, not guessed: USART3->BRR was swept live over SWD while the
 * ground dongle was captured. Only at 921600 does the payload survive -- 218 distinct
 * byte values and the full 59-float test ramp verbatim; every lower rate collapses the
 * stream to 1-2 distinct byte values and zero tails.
 *
 * APB1 is 42 MHz, so 921600 is not exactly representable: BRR = 0x2E gives 913043 baud,
 * -0.93%. Well inside 8N1 tolerance (~2%) and confirmed working on the wire.
 *
 * Lives in the header (not usart3.c) because API/subscribe.c sizes its stream
 * link-budget guard from it. The radio is no longer the binding constraint:
 * MEASURED 2026-08-09 the MicoAir WiFi module carried 55116 B/s at 0.00% loss
 * and its knee was never reached, so USART3_BAUD/10 = 91304 B/s is now the real
 * ceiling and the budget guard is conservative. See TASK/send_data.c. */

 * 3.6x the largest frame the throughput ladder emits (1124 B). The top rung
 * offers 90145 B/s against a 91304 B/s wire, i.e. only 1.3% drain margin, so
 * the ring's whole job there is to absorb Send_Task's jitter: that task is
 * preempted by the 1 kHz IMU and 200 Hz control loops, and two frames landing
 * back to back must not be scored as loss. 2048 B held only 1.8 frames, which
 * is too thin for that. One byte stays unused so head==tail means "empty". */

 * Returns 1 if the WHOLE frame was queued, 0 if it did not fit (in which case
 * nothing at all was written -- a partial frame would put a torn record on the
 * wire, which the host would score as corruption rather than as loss).
 *
 * REPLACED 2026-08-09 a one-frame-per-tick hand-off that armed the DMA directly
 * and returned 0 whenever the previous transfer was still draining. That guard
 * made frame size, not byte rate, the limit: at 884 B the transfer straddled the
 * Send_Task tick, every other tick was skipped, and the measured cadence
 * collapsed 80.2 -> 48.3 Hz even though the radio was losing nothing (0.00% at
 * every rung). Buffering instead of skipping decouples emission from the tick
 * and lets the link run to the UART wire rate. */
