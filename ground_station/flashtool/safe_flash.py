"""Safety-gated headless build + flash pipeline.

  python -m ground_station.flashtool gate     # read-only: is it safe to flash?
  python -m ground_station.flashtool build    # UV4 -b (no hardware)
  python -m ground_station.flashtool flash    # gate -> UV4 -f -> verify   (asks to confirm)
  python -m ground_station.flashtool verify   # read-only EKF liveness check
  python -m ground_station.flashtool all      # preflight -> build -> gate -> flash -> verify

The pipeline is built so the developer can run ``all`` repeatedly while the
drone sits powered on the bench (props off) and no human is required to flip
a power switch or click Build in uVision. The three guards that make that
work, in order:

* **Pre-flight interlocks** (``preflight.run_all``) — refuse if a uVision
  GUI instance is alive, or if another process is already holding the
  CMSIS-DAP interface.
* **Probe-free build** (``_pMon_neutralised``) — UV4 still drives the
  compile+link, but ``<pMon>`` in ``USER/JX_FLY.uvoptx`` is rewritten to
  the simulator DLL for the duration of the build and restored byte-exact
  afterwards. The CMSIS-DAP driver is never loaded, so a powered-on
  flight controller cannot be halted by the build step.
* **Build-identity guard** (``build_id.next_identity`` /
  ``build_id.check_identity``) — every successful build embeds a
  16-byte identity (magic + monotonic counter + epoch + source
  fingerprint) into the firmware image itself; the safety gate reads it
  back over the probe and refuses unless the local ``.axf`` matches the
  firmware actually flashed. Closes the relink drift hazard that
  previously made the gate's own readings untrustworthy.

The gate reads the RUNNING firmware over the probe (read-only, via livewatch)
and refuses unless ARM_Status==DisArmed and no motor bench test is active.
Reflash halts and resets the core; motors are unpowered during it and boot
disarmed. Over the WIRELESS probe a dropped link mid-write can corrupt
flash, so ``flash`` / ``all`` require an explicit confirmation (``--yes`` to
bypass in trusted automation) and UV4 verifies after.
