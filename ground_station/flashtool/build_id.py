"""Build identity stamping and verification.

Every relink moves RAM symbol addresses — measured 2026-07-26:
``DroneStatus`` shifted from ``0x20016138`` to ``0x200161d8`` (160 B). livewatch
resolves names to addresses out of ``OBJ/JX_FLY.axf``, and the safety gate in
``safe_flash.py`` reads ``DroneStatus.ARM_Status`` through that resolution. If
the local ELF is a fresh build that has not been flashed, the gate's own
decision would be made on garbage.

The build identity is a 4-word tuple stamped into the firmware image itself:

  ``build_id[0] = MAGIC (0xB10DCAFE)``       — recognisable prefix
  ``build_id[1] = build_counter``            — monotonic, incremented per build
  ``build_id[2] = build_epoch_seconds``      — when this build was emitted
  ``build_id[3] = source_fingerprint``       — SHA-256 of source-file mtimes/sizes

A build counter avoids the chicken-and-egg problem a content hash would have:
counter N+1's ELF always carries counter N+1 as ``build_id[1]``, regardless of
whether the source changed or only the link order moved. A source fingerprint
catches "the developer edited something but forgot to rebuild" cases. Together
they prove "this ELF was produced by build N+1 at time T, from sources with
fingerprint F" — enough to catch every stale-ELF scenario the 2026-07-26
12-byte .bss drift would have silently corrupted.

Stamping works by:

1. Generate ``OBJ/build_id.c`` containing ``volatile uint32_t build_id[4]``
   with the four constants above.
2. Add the file to ``USER/JX_FLY.uvprojx`` under a dedicated ``<Group>``
   named ``BUILDTOOLS``.
3. Build (UV4 picks the file up; the symbol resolves in DWARF).
4. Remove the ``<Group>`` and delete the file on context exit, byte-exact.

At runtime ``build_id[0..3]`` lives in ``.data`` (initialised to the literal
at startup, then RAM-resident). ``check_identity()`` reads it through the
existing ``LiveReader`` and compares against the locally-recorded identity
for the ELF on disk. A match proves the local ELF describes the firmware
actually flashed on the target.

The mechanism is intentionally simple — no compiler/linker trickery, no new
firmware C source change (out of scope → spec 3). The stamp is the build
artifact itself; the host needs no separate "build_id.txt" alongside.
