"""Rebuild and flash the firmware, deterministically, with the drone powered on.

    python -m ground_station.flashtool.rebuild_and_flash              # build only
    python -m ground_station.flashtool.rebuild_and_flash --yes        # build + flash

This encodes the sequence validated on live hardware on 2026-07-29 so that a
future session does not have to rediscover it. Every step below exists because
something went wrong without it.

**The build no longer requires powering the drone down.** A headless build once
halted the flight controller -- LED dark, ESCs beeping, no self-recovery -- because
loading the uVision project initialises ``<pMon>BIN\\CMSIS_AGDI.dll`` and that
driver claims the probe over SWD. ``safe_flash._pMon_neutralised`` points ``<pMon>``
at the simulator DLL for the duration of the build and restores the file byte-exact,
so the CMSIS-DAP driver is never loaded. Verified with the target powered and
streaming telemetry throughout, before and after.

The remaining hazards this handles:

* **A rebuild relinks and RAM symbols move** (measured: ``DroneStatus.ARM_Status``
  0x20016776 -> 0x200169E6). Between building and flashing, the on-disk ELF
  describes an image the drone is not running. So the artifact triple is snapshotted
  first, the pre-flash safety read resolves names through the *snapshot*, and a
  failed flash restores it -- otherwise livewatch and every safety gate that
  resolves addresses would be reading the wrong ones.
* **Flashing over the wireless probe fails intermittently.** ``Erase Done.
  Programming Failed!RDDI-DAP Error`` leaves the part erased and the drone dark.
  That is an incomplete write, not a brick, and a plain retry has fixed it. So
  flashing retries rather than escalating a transient to the operator.
* **Flashing is not consented to by the drone being powered on.** ``--yes`` is
  required; without it this builds and stops.

Exit codes are per-stage so an unattended caller cannot mistake a failure for
success: 2 UV4 resident, 3 build failed, 4 uvoptx not restored, 5 target dark,
6 not disarmed / unreadable, 7 flash failed after retries, 8 dark after flash.
