/* UART5 extended-prefix (0xCC 0xDE) subscription producer.
 *
 * Implements the firmware-side of HANDOFF §5 item 1: host sends a list of
 * (address:uint32 LE, size:uint16 LE) tuples on UART5; firmware validates
 * each tuple against the SRAM/CCM allowlist, packs the requested bytes
 * from those addresses, and replies with either a 0x07 tuple reply or a
 * 0x7F error reply. Read-only observation: nothing in this module writes
 * to the requested addresses.

 *  - Address allowlist: SRAM 0x20000000..0x2001FFFF and CCM 0x10000000..0x1000FFFF.
 *    Bounds derived from OBJ/JX_FLY.map RW_IRAM1 region (Max 0x20000) and
 *    STM32F407 datasheet (CCM 64 KB at 0x10000000).
 *  - size must be in {1, 2, 4}; address must be aligned to size.
 *  - Send_Task stack is 500 words (2 kB); no stack locals > 32 B. Reply
 *    and error buffers are file-scope statics in API/subscribe.c.

/* ---- Streaming subscription (CMD 0x21) ---------------------------------
 *
 * The 0x20 path above is a POLL: one request, one reply, done. Streaming
 * adds three things it lacks -- repetition at a chosen rate, a choice of
 * transport, and range tuples.
 *
 * Range tuples are what make it affordable. The 0x07 reply repeats the
 * address and size in every frame: 10 bytes on the wire to deliver one
 * float32, 60% overhead. A stream re-sends that identical schema 80 times
 * a second for no information. So the schema is sent ONCE (frame 0x08) at
 * subscribe time and the data frames (0x09) carry values only:
 *
 *     32 float32, repeating schema : 6 + 32*10 + 1 = 327 B  -> 26.3 kB/s
 *     32 float32, schema once      : 6 + 32*4  + 1 = 135 B  -> 10.9 kB/s
 *
 * and `count` lets one tuple name a whole contiguous array, so a request
 * stays ~200 B whether it subscribes to 8 values or 256.
 *
 * Host -> FC request frame (CMD 0x21, on UART5):
 *
 *   offset  width  field
 *   0       1      SYNC_HI                    0xCC
 *   1       1      SYNC_LO                    0xDE
 *   2       1      CMD                        0x21
 *   3       1      LEN_HI                     (payload length >> 8) & 0xFF
 *   4       1      LEN_LO                     (payload length) & 0xFF
 *   5       1      N_RANGES                   range count
 *   6       1      DIVIDER                    0 = stop; k = emit every k-th cycle
 *   7       1      TRANSPORT                  0 = UART5, 1 = USART3
 *   8       1      SLOT                       0..SUBSCRIBE_MAX_SLOTS-1
 *   9       8*N    payload: N ranges of (address:uint32 LE, size:uint16 LE,
 *                                        count:uint16 LE)
 *   trailer CRC8 XOR over [CMD .. payload]
 *
 *   payload length = 3 + N*8  (the three config bytes count as payload)
 *
 * FC -> host schema frame (0x08, replied on UART5, once per accepted request):
 *
 *   0..2    3      0xAA 0xBB 0x08
 *   3..4    2      LEN_HI LEN_LO              payload length = 5 + N*8
 *   5       1      N_RANGES
 *   6       1      DIVIDER                    as accepted
 *   7       1      TRANSPORT                  as accepted
 *   8       1      SLOT                       as accepted
 *   9..10   2      TOTAL_BYTES (BE)           data-frame payload width
 *   11      8*N    the accepted ranges, echoed
 *   trailer CRC8 XOR
 *
 * FC -> host data frame, on the selected transport, every DIVIDER cycles.
 * The frame type encodes the slot: 0x09 + slot, i.e. 0x09/0x0A/0x0B/0x0C.
 * That way a host decodes each slot independently with no extra framing.
 *
 *   0..2    3      0xAA 0xBB (0x09 + SLOT)
 *   3..4    2      LEN_HI LEN_LO              payload length = 4 + TOTAL_BYTES
 *   5       1      SEQ                        per-slot; gaps = dropped frames
 *   6..9    4      T_MS (uint32 LE)           SOURCE timestamp, ms since boot
 *   10      ...    values, packed in range order, no addresses
 *   trailer CRC16-CCITT (XModem), big-endian, over [FRAME_TYPE .. last value]
 *
 * T_MS is `xTaskGetTickCount()` and configTICK_RATE_HZ is 1000, so it is
 * milliseconds since boot, sampled in the same Send_Task cycle that copies the
 * values. It exists because the host's arrival time is smeared by USB and OS
 * scheduling -- fine for "is it adapting", useless for system identification.
 * Values inside ONE frame were always simultaneous; T_MS is what makes the
 * spacing BETWEEN frames trustworthy. It wraps at 2^32 ms (~49.7 days).
 *
 * CRC16-CCITT rather than the CRC8 XOR used elsewhere: XOR cannot see byte
 * transpositions or any even number of bit flips in a column, so a corrupted
 * frame can pass and land in the dataset looking plausible. These frames ARE
 * the dataset. The 0x08 schema and 0x7F error frames keep CRC8 -- they are
 * one-shot control-plane frames parsed by the shared envelope reader, and a
 * corrupted schema is caught instead by the host checking that every echoed
 * range is one it actually asked for.
 *
 * MULTI-RATE. Slots are independent subscriptions with their own variables,
 * rate and transport, which is how one link carries signals that deserve very
 * different attention:
 *
 *     slot 0  Theta weights + attitude   divider 1   ~80 Hz
 *     slot 1  battery, RPM               divider 8   ~10 Hz
 *     slot 2  EKF states                 divider 40   ~2 Hz
 *
 * At most ONE data frame is emitted per Send_Task cycle. When several slots
 * come due together they are served round-robin and the unserved ones stay
 * due, so a busy slot cannot starve a quiet one. The budget guard sums ALL
 * slots on a transport, so slots cannot collectively oversubscribe the link.
 *
 * Rejections reuse the existing 0x7F error frame on UART5.
 *
 * SECURITY NOTE: the request is accepted on UART5 only -- the wireless
 * CMSIS-DAP link. USART3 (the radio) carries the data stream but still has
 * NO command parser, so promoting telemetry to the radio adds no inbound
 * attack surface. Control plane on the debugger, data plane on the radio.
